# DS_problems

This repository contains a curated collection of **Data Structures problems** that Iâ€™ve implemented and solved to practice key concepts, improve coding fluency, and build a personal reference library.

## ðŸ“‚ Contents

- Classical and advanced data structure problems
- Handwritten implementations from scratch (not library-dependent)
- Optimized solutions following textbook (e.g., CLRS) and contest standards

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used

- **Java** â€” primary language for implementations
  
## ðŸ“‹ Topics Covered

âœ… Arrays and lists  
âœ… Stacks and queues  
âœ… Linked lists (singly, doubly, circular)  
âœ… Trees (binary trees, BST, AVL, Red-Black trees)  
âœ… Heaps (min/max, Fibonacci heap)  
âœ… Hash tables and hash maps
